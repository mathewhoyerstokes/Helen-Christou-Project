Project one --- Add Tip jar to site

- Everything that you do on the Blockchain is Public.
- The blockchain is a database that we can only add to,and is like a ledger of everything that has ever been done.
- Ethereum has smart contracts.


what the project entails.

- when i click this form > then i want to send some money to a certain account. 

- starting with the JS and add a event to the form button (See tip.js)

- if the user does not have a wallet then what do we want to do. we can use this code.

if (window.ethereum) {
    form.classList.add("has-eth")
}

the window.ethereum is injected into the page when you are using metamask. so we can use JS and say that if the user does not have a wallet then show a alert. 
this could be replaced with alot of different things.
if (window.ethereum) {
        form.style.backgroundColor = "red"
    } else {
        alert("Please install a wallet")
    }

abstract the code by using a new const for the send function and then run it inside the submit function.

- async function?

- the value in ethereum is called a 'weig' we are going to use a libary to get the base(weig unit) the libary is 'web3.js'

Ganache we can use to set up our own Blockchain
